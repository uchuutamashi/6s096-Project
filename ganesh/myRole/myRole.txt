I was primarily responsible for the engine (e.g integrator, physics). The
integrators were wholly created by me (Euler, Runge Kutta order 2, Runge Kutta
order 4). I was also responsible for many of the physics tests (the initial
ones were written by Steven). I also wrote the Vector3 tests. I also did some
work in cleaning up some of the code to reflect the class coding standards
(this was shared with Steven and Eric).
